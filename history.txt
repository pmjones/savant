Started with mixed html & php like everyone else

Read about fastTemplate

Wrote own block-substitution system

Heard about Smarty

Used it for a few projects

Began to get tired of it ...
... hard to update, non-intuitive from PHP point of view
... but wasn't "templating" the "right thing" to do?
... so stuck with it until:

Read articles from Fuecks and Lozier saying that PHP was itself a template language.

Realized that it wasn't templating that bothered me, it was Smarty and all it entailed.

Wrote class to do do the core tasks of templating (assignment, inclusion)
... but with plain PHP as the template markup.

Public release was intended for PEAR as HTML_Template_Dummy (Sum 2003)
... floated a pre-proposal, not received well

Greg Beaver picked up on it, worked with me to get auto-discovered plugins and filters going

That was Savant 1.

Did a real PEAR proposal, down in flames; seemed more a referendum on template situation in PEAR than a vote on Savant itself (Spr 2004?)

Frankly, just as well it didn't get in;  code in PEAR seems to stagnate once you've gone through all the work of getting it in in the first place.

Wrote Savant2 after the PEAR debacle. (Sum/Fall 2004)

Started a PHP5 E_STRICT version (Savant3) earlier this year.
